C Program to Find the Day of a Given Date
This program takes a date (in the format dd-mm-yyyy) as input and calculates the day of the week on which it falls. The program is written in C and can be compiled using any C compiler.



How to Use:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g. gcc).
- Run the executable file and enter the date when prompted.



Algorithm :
The program uses Zeller's congruence algorithm to calculate the day of the week. The algorithm takes the date as input and returns an integer between 0 and 6, where 0 represents Saturday, 1 represents Sunday, and so on. The program then uses an array to map the integer to the corresponding day of the week.
